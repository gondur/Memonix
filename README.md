this package contains http://ftp.internat.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles/MemonixSourceCode_1.6_070713.zip (~1MB)
but not https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141500/http://www.viewizard.com/download/MemonixSourceArt_1.6_070717.zip (122MB)
as I could not locate a mirror. Instead, the assets from the binary release are included (which were much smaller 8MB).
